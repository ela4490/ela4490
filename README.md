Hey everyone, I'm Ela! I'm a programming enthusiast and a tech savvy with ~10 years of experience designing and managing all aspects of the development process from small to medium-sized companies. Also, works as an end-to-end product developer (user experience and full-stack engineering) on a product which is powered by Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing technologies. I write technical essays on various engineering topics on [Medium](https://ela4490.medium.com/). You can follow also me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ela-singh-4490/).
